The protocol aims to build a common informational interface by which exchanges, brokerages, and traders can reasonably price a tokenized debt default risk without having to rely on a singular centralized data broker. The debt issuance scheme leverages two classes of utility players that compete in distinct marketplaces for compensatory fees -- underwriters and relayers. The former are trusted originators and assessors of debtor default risk, and the latter facilitate the funding and issuance of debts in a trustless manner. Both can be empirically evaluated on historical asset performance, and, as such, markets have lucid signals with which to evaluate the default risk of tokenized debts attested to by any given underwriter or relayer.
